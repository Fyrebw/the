## FAQ
- Q: why his model fucked up
  - A: first character I ever concepted, modeled, or animated. I made it a point not to fix any of the issues with it because funny
- Q: Faceless Joe? A unique name? This is Risk of Rain reeeeee
  - A: Aha but it's not a unique name. Risk of Rain characters usually have general names that can describe anyone in a group of people. Faceless Joe is just that, describes no one in particular. Anyone in Risk of Rain could be called a Faceless Joe.
- Q: FAQ before the mod even came out?
  - A: FAQ's are just a good layout for bullets. In this case (stolen from Tom Scott), FAQ stands for Fully Anticipated Questions
