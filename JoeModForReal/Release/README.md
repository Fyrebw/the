## Credits
literally no one else to credit wow  
uh my mom for giving birth to me

## FAQ
- Q: why his model fucked up
  - A: first character I ever concepted, modeled, or animated. I made it a point not to fix any of the issues with it because funny
- Q: Joe? A unique name in Risk of Rain REEEEEE
  - A: Aha but it's not a unique name. Risk of Rain characters usually have general names that can describe anyone in a group of people. Faceless Joe is just that, describes no one in particular. Anyone in Risk of Rain could be called a faceless Joe.
- Q: FAQ before the mod even came out?
  - A: FAQ's are just a good layout for essentially bullet points. In this case (stolen from Tom Scott), FAQ stands for Fully Anticipated Questions

## Known Issues
- he not done

## Future Plans (that I may or may not get to)
- FINALLY GET FUCKING ARTIFACT OF VENGEANCE
- Scepter, Skills++, Emote
- Character was made just for fun, but if he's enjoyable enough and anyone would like to help with models, icons, etc, I'm down to put in the work making him a real character.
