But I need to, because the charcoals I want can't come from any coconuts. They need to have the perfect lighting temperature, the perfect lifetime, the perfect shape, the perfect flavor-capturing smoke. No, the charcoals I need can only be made from special trees. Trees in a forest just over this hill, habibi. But we're not gonna burn it down, absolutely not. If the trees are gone, how are we gonna get any charcoal? No, we can’t destroy the trees and take from them. We want them to be happy, to help us achieve our dreams of the perfect smoke because they like us. Make sense? Didn’t think so, hehaha. Nice O’s, you’re getting better at those. Anyways, in this forest, there's someone who’s been able to earn the trust of the trees. Maybe if we hand him a hose, and he’ll put his swords down and join us, haha.",
