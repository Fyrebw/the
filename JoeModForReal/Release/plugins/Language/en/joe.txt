Never seen any of those before.<color=#CCD3E0>\n\n< ! > the Falling jump Attack is primarily useful for its wide range against multiple enemies.\n\n< ! > the Fireball does hefty damage, but knocks enemies back, making it more useful to finish enemies or get them away from you\n\n< ! > Dash can be used freely to mitigate some damage from hits. use the charged melee version to get to enemies up in the air, then double jump to stay at their level.\n\n< ! > the ward of Tenticles will help you in a pinch, and enable you to stay in combat amidst a group of enemies\n\n",

You don't have to chop down an entire tree just to get your charcoal.\nBut I need to, because the charcoals I want can't come from any coconuts. They need to have the perfect lighting temperature, the perfect lifetime, the perfect shape, the perfect flavor-capturing smoke. No, the charcoals I need can only be made from special trees. Trees in a forest just over this hill, habibi.\nBut we're not going to burn it down, absolutely not. If the trees are gone, how are we gonna get any charcoal? No, we can’t destroy the trees and take from them. We want them to be happy, to help us achieve our dreams of the perfect smoke because they like us.\nMake sense? Didn’t think so, hehaha. Nice O’s, by the way. You’re getting better at those.\nAnyways, in this forest, there's someone who’s been able to earn the trust of the trees. Maybe if we hand him a hose, he’ll put his swords down and join us, haha.",
